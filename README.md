# the Study of code review_assignment
OpenStack has been used for code review for many repositories. Allocating the code review tasks to code reviewers is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. It is important to categorize the type of code check-ins. Please take a look at [https://review.opendev.org/Links](https://review.opendev.org/Links) to an external site., export a list of more than 500 check-ins, or use the attached file [Code_Review_Project-1.csv](https://github.com/IHsuanHu/Study_of_code_review_assignment/blob/master/Code_Review_Project-1.csv)clustering each row/sample based on their architectural attributes, example, documentation related, performance improvement, test coverage or improve testability, security enhancement, etc.  The clustering methods can be simply keywords-based, machine learning-based, or any other approaches you would like to explore.
